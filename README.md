# Automated-Cover-Letters
Python script that takes arguments for [Company Name], [Job Position],  [Requisition ID], and [Contact], resulting in dynamically generated cover letters, outputted in .docx and .pdf extension, organized into respective subdirectories.

Future Update:
Along with base information, I have a set of pre-written paragraphs that talk about some projects I have completed. Based on my input of [1, 2, or 3], the letter will talk about a different combination of my 
projects, to highlight the skillsets most relevant to the position.
